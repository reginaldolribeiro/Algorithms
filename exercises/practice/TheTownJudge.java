     * Identifies the town judge based on trust relationships.
     *
     * The town judge is defined as:
     * 1. A person who does not trust anyone (their trust count is 0).
     * 2. A person who is trusted by everyone else (trusted by exactly n-1 people).
     *
     * Algorithm:
     * 1. Validate the input:
     *    - If the trust array is null, throw an exception.
     *    - Handle special cases:
     *      - If `n == 1` and `trust` is empty, the only person is the judge.
     *      - If `n < 1`, return -1 (invalid case).
     * 2. Use two arrays to track trust relationships:
     *    - `regular`: Counts how many people each person trusts.
     *    - `judges`: Counts how many people trust each person.
     * 3. Iterate through the trust array:
     *    - Increment the `regular` count for the person who trusts (`first`).
     *    - Increment the `judges` count for the person being trusted (`second`).
     * 4. Identify the judge:
     *    - A person is the judge if:
     *      - Their `regular` count is 0 (does not trust anyone).
     *      - Their `judges` count is `n-1` (trusted by everyone else).
     * 5. Return the judge if found; otherwise, return -1.
     *
     * Big O Notation:
     * - Time Complexity: O(n + trust.length) â€” Traverses the trust array and checks the results.
     * - Space Complexity: O(n) â€” Uses two arrays of size `n` to track trust relationships.
     *
     * @param n     The number of people in the town.
     * @param trust The trust relationships represented as a 2D array.
     * @return The label of the town judge, or -1 if no judge exists.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the trust array is null.
